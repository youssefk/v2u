        <div class="col-md-8">
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>It all began in late 2009.  Adam had lost his job as a web programmer, the economy was in shambles and his prospects were slim.  He needed hope.  He didn't know it then, but he needed Veggies (and a spark from Eve).</p>
          <p>A friend, on a lark, offerred up his foodtruck to live in while he looked for work.  As a former (reformed?) web programmer, he spent all of his time on his computer.  Until his Macbook broke.  And he was forced to go to the Apple store, where chamce would have it, he met Eve, who changed his life.</p>
          <p>Eve had had enough of Apple, and wanted change herself.  She called Apple the forbidden fruit, so she jumped at the chance to join Adam in the foodtruck and begin selling that green alternative - Veggies!  And thus, Veggies2U was born.</p>

          <h3>About Adam</h3>
          <p>Adam BigBeard is a web-programmer turned veggie entreprenuer.  He loves kale chips, long walks on the farm and listening to poetry.</p>
          <p>Adam is responsible for making deliveries for Veggies 2 U, and manning the VegVan (it is not a VW diesel!) when parked at community events.  It gives him no greater joy than seeing the look on a kid's face when they bite a beet for the first time...and hate it.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <h3>About Eve</h3>
          <p>Eve TreeClimber spent much of her formative years in that garden of technology, Apple, rising up to be their local blue-shirt leader.  She fixed iPhone screens, glued together iPads that kids stepped on and generally kept big Apple churning in Portland.</p>
          <p>Eve loves spending time with her dog on the farm, hiking in the mountains with Adam and planning the next crop for Veggies2U.</p>
          <p>Eve's favorite veggie is the carrot. It was her high school mascott.
